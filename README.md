# LCRYPT
Unbreakable encryption on binary level even knowing the procedure.
Knowing that all information in digital format is stored in its purest form of zeros and ones, I began to contemplate how to effectively erase the contents of a file, ensuring it can be decrypted using the correct keys. Without them, deciphering it would be like rewriting a dictionary from a huge alphabet soup.
